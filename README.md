# 🔎 Entry-Level Data Job Search Analysis (Inspired by Avery Smith)

> "If the job market is on fire, at least I can see it well-organized while it burns." — Me, turning panic into pivot tables.

## 📘 Overview

This project was inspired by a video/podcast/email/LinkedIn post from [Avery Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/averyjsmith/) who shared a creative workaround for the brutal entry-level data job market: look for roles that **aren't** labeled “Data Analyst” — but still get your foot in the door.

I took his advice seriously and turned it into a mini data project. The idea: search for 6 of Avery’s suggested job titles across major job sites, organize the results in Excel, and explore the data using pivot tables.

## 🎯 Objective

With the job market being particularly tough for aspiring data analysts, I wanted to identify whether certain lesser-known job titles really offer more accessible entry points. Specifically, I asked:

- How many jobs show up under each of Avery's recommended titles?
- Which titles and sites yield the most opportunities?
- Are remote jobs common under these titles?

Rather than just apply for these jobs, I turned the job hunt into a dataset — because that's what data people do.

## 🧩 Job Titles Researched

These six roles came directly from Avery Smith's recommendations:

1. Data Specialist  
2. Data Clerk  
3. Data Coordinator  
4. Data Steward  
5. Data Assistant  
6. Data Entry  

## 🌐 Job Sites Used

I searched for each of these titles across the following job boards:

- LinkedIn  
- Indeed  
- Glassdoor  
- Monster  
- FlexJobs  
- DataJobs  
- **Bonus**: [FindADataJob.com](https://findadatajob.com) — Avery Smith’s curated job board

Each search included both remote roles and on-site roles near my location.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- **Excel** – Data entry, cleaning, visualization, and pivot table analysis  
- **Manual Search** – Simulating the job-seeking experience  
- **Medium & GitHub** – For documenting and sharing the journey  

## 📁 Project Structure

- Search each website for the respective 6 job titles.
- Document results for both On-Site, and Remote positions in an excel spread sheet
- Build a pivot table out of the results
- Begin Analyzing and visualizing data to gain insights.
